## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deep-Learning-Assignments.git
   cd Deep-Learning-Assignments
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Alternatively, you can open the project in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** and run the notebooks using the built-in Jupyter extension.

5. Navigate to the desired assignment folder and run the notebook.

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook / VS Code with Jupyter Extension
* TensorFlow / PyTorch
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* OpenCV (for image-related assignments)

## 📑 Notes

* Each assignment has a **`.docx` report** with explanations and results.
